## Overview

This is a Project for week 4 under Coursera Data Science Specialization Programme.
It has two parts which covered:- 

1. Shiny for web application.<br>https://ridzuanmo.shinyapps.io/mpg_consumption_analysis/
   
2. Slidify for pitch presentation about the application.<br>http://rpubs.com/ridzuanmo/mpg_analysis

## Shiny Application

The application allow users to visualize the relationship between selected variable, mpg and automobiles. The scatter plot show which automobiles and variable consume gas effectively.

- User may select variables such as Weight, Horsepower, Cylinder and Gear.
- User may resize data sample by define the range for QSec (1/4 mile time)

## Dataset

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

However, we only interested at 5 variable as shown in the table below and row name's represent automobiles models.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(mtcars[,c("mpg", "wt", "gear", "cyl", "qsec")])
```

## Plot

The relationship between Weigth, MPG and Automobiles

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

mtcars$model = sub(" .*", "", rownames(mtcars))
mtcars$model <- factor(mtcars$model)

ggplot(mtcars, aes_string("wt", "mpg")) +
          geom_point(aes(colour = model), size = 4) +
          guides(color=guide_legend(title="Automobiles")) +
          xlab("Weight (1000 lbs)") +
          ylab("Miles/(US) gallon") + 
          ggtitle("MPG vs Weight (1000 lbs) vs Automobiles")
```
